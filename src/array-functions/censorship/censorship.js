/*
Create a function `censor` which takes an array of sentences and a forbidden word as argument, then returns the array with the word censored.

A censored word is replaced with asterisks, example: "tacos" -> "*****".

Only a full word should be censored.

sentences: [
  "I love the smell of tacos in the morning.",
  "Where is my umbrella?",
  "The test is not a diagnosis of the disease psittacosis.",
  "Eat tacos every day."
]
forbidden word: "tacos"

result: [
  "I love the smell of ***** in the morning.",
  "Where is my umbrella?",
  "The test is not a diagnosis of the disease psittacosis.",
  "Eat ***** every day."
]

You can't use a loop!

Don't mutate the parameter.
